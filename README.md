## Overview

The Chomsky-Conversion project aims to implement a conversion process that transforms a Context Free Grammar (CFG) into Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CFGs are powerful language representations, but CNF simplifies the structure, making it easier for certain algorithms and parsers to operate.

### Built With

This project is developed using Python, a versatile programming language known for its extensive library support and documentation. Python is an excellent choice for handling structured data from JSON input files.

## Features

The Chomsky-Conversion program simplifies Context Free Grammars (CFGs) by converting them into Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). It accepts CFGs in JSON format as input and generates CNFs in JSON format as output. This conversion streamlines CFGs for use in various algorithms and parsers, achieved through functions that eliminate useless productions, handle Îµ (empty string) rules, remove unit productions, and manage diverse right-hand side combinations. Developed in Python, the program accommodates CFGs of varying complexity.
